> Flexible token replay animation for process maps

[![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/processanimater)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=processanimater)
[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

Flexible token replay animation for process maps created through the [processmapR](https://github.com/gertjanssenswillen/processmapR/) package from the [bupaR](http://www.bupar.net) suite. This package uses [htmlwidgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/) and SVG animations ([SMIL](https://www.w3.org/standards/techs/smil#w3c_all)) to create the animation. Sizes, colors, and the image used for tokens are customizable based on trace, event attributes, or a secondary data frame if an attribute does not change according to the original event log. 

## Getting Started

### Installing

ProcessanimateR is not yet available on CRAN. Please use the remotes package or similar means to install it directly from source.

```r
# install the remotes package
source("https://install-github.me/r-lib/remotes")

# use remotes to install the latest version of processanimateR
remotes::install_github("fmannhardt/processanimateR")

# or install a specific tag
remotes::install_github("fmannhardt/processanimateR@v0.1.0")
```

### Usage

There are two main functions: `animate_process` and `ianimate_process` (interactive version).

We use the `patients` event log provided by the `eventdataR` package. 
```r
library(processanimateR)
library(eventdataR)
data(patients)
```

A basic animation with static color and token size:
```r
animate_process(patients)
```

Default token color or size can be changed as follows:
```r
animate_process(patients, token_size = 2)
animate_process(patients, token_color = "red")
```

Dynamic token color or size can be achieved as follows:
```r
animate_process(add_token_color(patients, "time", "color"), token_color = "color")
animate_process(add_token_color(patients, "employee", "color", color_mapping = scales::col_factor("Paired", patients$employee)),
                token_color = "color")
```

There is also an interactive variant that starts a Shiny web-application. It expects that attributes are of an apropriate data type to choose a good color scale.
```r
library(edeaR)
library(dplyr)
ianimate_process(sepsis %>%
 filter_trace_frequency(percentage = 0.3) %>%
 # we fix the datatype of some of the attributes to allow proper rendering of the token color
 # the token size option currently only support numeric attributes
 mutate_at(c("lacticacid", "leucocytes", "crp", "age"), as.numeric) %>%
 mutate_at(c("disfuncorg", "sirscriteria2ormore", "infectionsuspected"), as.logical))
```

## Libraries Used
This package makes use of the following libraries:
* [d3](https://d3js.org), to dynamically changing the SVG;
* [fakesmil](https://github.com/FakeSmile/FakeSmile), to provide SMIL support in most browsers;
* [svg-pan-zoom](https://github.com/ariutta/svg-pan-zoom), for the panning/zooming option;
* [viz](https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js/), to compile the DOT generated by processmapR in JavaScript;
* [bupaR](https://github.com/gertjanssenswillen/bupaR), for the base Process Mining functions in R.
